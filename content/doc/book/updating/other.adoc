# Upgrading Jenkins  
If updates are available, Jenkins will notify you.

== FreeBSD

To upgrade Jenkins itself, do so from the ports tree. Connect to your FreeBSD machine, get root access and update your ports tree:
```
    portsnap fetch update
```
Then build and reinstall Jenkins:
```
    cd /usr/ports/devel/jenkins
    make reinstall clean BATCH=yes
```
And restart the service:
```
    service jenkins restart
```
