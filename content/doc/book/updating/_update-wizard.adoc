There are a few post upgrade steps to perform.

=== Verify the version update

The Jenkins server is up and running. Let's now verify the version from the Jenkins dashboard:

The upgraded Jenkins version can be seen at the bottom right corner of the Jenkins UI.

=== Compatibility with the new version

Plugins are probably the most crucial part of the Jenkins pipeline. In fact, each job uses a plugin for its execution.
Check the available updates for installed plugins:

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard
. Click on Manage Jenkins in the Jenkins dashboard
. Click on About Plugins

The above image shows that there is no need to update any plugins.

After upgrading Jenkins, you may *encounter data compatibility issues with the new version*. 
Therefore, to ensure that our data is in the correct format, we should update it to the updated format. 
Furthermore, to check the data version update, follow these steps:

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard
. Click on Manage Jenkins in the Jenkins dashboard
