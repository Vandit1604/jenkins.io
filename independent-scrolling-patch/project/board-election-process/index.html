Board and Officer election process
</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being.
This document outlines the <a href="/project/governance/#governance-board">Jenkins Governance Board</a> and <a href="/project/team-leads/">Jenkins officer</a> election process.
The election process is driven by the Jenkins Governance board members who are not up for reelection (aka the <em>election committee</em>).
More contributors might be added to the election committee if approved by the <a href="/project/governance-meeting/">regular governance meeting</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The charter of the Jenkins board is to ensure the health of not only the software project, but of the communities of plugin developers and users.
To do this effectively, members of the board must bring various perspectives to the table: what are the needs of users; of committers; of organizations, both large and small; of commercial interests.
As the composition of the Jenkins board changes over time, we want to ensure this balance of viewpoints is maintained.
Current board members understand this balance, and are in the best position to select new candidates.
A board comprised fully of write-in candidates runs the risk of being overweighed with one type of perspective over all others.</p>

<h3 id="nominations"><a class="anchor" href="#nominations"></a>Nominations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The opinion of members of the community at large is highly valued, and the board welcomes additional nominations beyond who we might consider.
If you feel that a particular person is well suited to help guide Jenkins, please submit a name and the reason for your nomination to the <a href="https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-committee">Jenkins Election Committee</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The election committee will review all submissions and compile a final list of candidates to be voted on by the community, for the board member seats and officer roles up for election.
The board reserves the right to omit nominations from the final ballot if they feel that a particular viewpoint is already well represented on the board, or if there are other reasons preventing a nominee from being effective in the target role.
In the case of rejection, a justification must be provided to the contributor who submitted the nomination.
The decision may be escalated to the <a href="/project/governance-meeting/">Jenkins governance meeting</a> and overridden by voting there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After receiving and vetting the nominations, the election committee is responsible for contacting the nominees and confirming whether they want to run in the election.
The candidates should also provide their statements, list of affiliations (see <a href="#corporate-disclosure">Corporate Disclosure</a>), any account/social media links which may help voters to get more information about them, and plans if they are elected to the role.
This information is published by the election committee before the voting starts.</p>

<p>Any Jenkins project and/or community contributor is eligible to vote in the election if there is a contribution made before September 01 of the election year.
Contributing does not only mean a <em>code contribution</em>, as <a href="/participate">contributions</a> could be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documentation updates or creation</p>

<p>As long as you are contributing to the Jenkins project or community, you are eligible to register for voting.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Voter registration is announced through the Jenkins mailing lists, blog, and social media accounts.
Users can register to vote in the election by joining the <a href="https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2022">2022 election voter group</a>.
Previous elections utilized their own groups, so joining the <a href="https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2022">2022 group</a> is required for participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To register, you must have an account on <a href="https://community.jenkins.io">community.jenkins.io</a>.
You can use your existing Github account, or create a new account specifically for <a href="https://community.jenkins.io">Jenkins community discussion</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once voter registration is over, the election committee will process the form submissions and prepare a list of the registered voters.
In the case of rejection, one of the election committee members will send a rejection email.</p>

<h3 id="voting"><a class="anchor" href="#voting"></a>Voting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Voting happens through the <a href="https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/">Condorcet Internet Voting Service</a>.
Once the voting period begins, all voters will receive a notification to the email used for your <a href="https://community.jenkins.io">Jenkins community account</a>.
There will be separate emails for each role (board members and each officer) with more than 1 candidate.
If you have not received an email within 24 hours from the voting start date, please contact the <a href="https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-committee">Jenkins Election Committee</a>.
Every contributor can vote only once, and multiple intentional votes will be considered a violation and serious misbehavior, subject to the <a href="/conduct">Jenkins Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Voters will have at least two weeks to submit their votes.
Voting is anonymous.
Each voter ranks a set of possible choices.
Individual voter rankings are then combined into an anonymous overall ranking of the choices.
Refer to <a href="https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/">this page</a> for more information about the ranking algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once voting is over, the election committee will process the results, notify the elected candidates, and prepare the announcement.
The results should be announced shortly after the elections, in the Jenkins mailing lists, blog, and social accounts.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="post-announcement"><a class="anchor" href="#post-announcement"></a>Post-announcement</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Voting results take effect immediately after the announcement.
Board members and former officers are responsible to organize knowledge and permission transfers for the newly elected contributors.
The transition process is to be defined by former and newly elected contributors,
with an expectation that the transition concludes within one month after the results announcement.</p>

<p>The election committee is responsible to hold a retrospective for the elections and to make the results of it public.</p>

<p>As an independent community, it is important to us that the Jenkins board does not become overly influenced by any one single corporate entity.

<p>To handle this within the election cycle, we do not wish to limit the candidacy for employees of any given company.</p>

<ul>

<p>Initially, the number of candidates per company is ignored and candidates are eliminated normally.</p>

<p>Winners are calculated.
If a company is over quota, we take any permanent seats from that company, and the top zero, one, or two candidates from that company (depending on how many permanent seats are held by affiliates of that company) and all the other candidates that aren&#8217;t affiliated with that company, dropping the lower placing candidates who are affiliated with that company.</p>
