<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="communications-are-in-english"><a class="anchor" href="#communications-are-in-english"></a>Communications are in English</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The official communication language is English, and English is a second
language to most of us. Learning proper English grammar is key to
good communications. This is a challenge for mentors and contributors alike.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We encourage all contributors to spend some time improving their knowledge of
the English language to increase their chances of success in open source.
There are many good videos on youtube that can help you improve written and spoken
English.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that the goal when communicating is to be understood.
Frequent grammar mistakes include
<a href="http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/runons.htm">run-on sentences</a> (they are confusing),
<a href="http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/fragments.htm">sentence fragments</a> (they are incomplete),
or miss constructing <a href="http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/clauses.htm">clauses</a>
and <a href="http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/phrases.htm">phrases</a> (confusing).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is always good to start at the basics,
that is how to write a sentence, and how to write a paragraph.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following links are suggestions to help you improve your communication skills:</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="communications-are-public"><a class="anchor" href="#communications-are-public"></a>Communications are public</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We expect almost all communications to be done in public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors and mentors do not communicate privately regarding the technical
aspects of the project or the GSoC program. Mentors are not expected to
respond to such contributors inquiries when made in private.  Contributors will
get much better answers when they ask in public rather than in private,
as mentors will collectively complement each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors please note that mentors do not have "special information",
or "privileged information" that they would reveal only to you
privately. Contributors should not ask mentors to hide information from
other contributors, this is simply not how open-source development works. In
open-source development, all ideas are presented and debated publicly.
All the information we have is in the project ideas, or is shared on
the public channels (for example gitter, Discourse channel, office hours).
Contributors are expected to find this information on their own using the
search tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributor proposals are also public. Contributors might be afraid of another
contributor copying their proposal or stealing their ideas, but there is
nothing to fear. First, mentors can easily tell when ideas and proposals
have been copied. Second, Jenkins is a community driven open source
development organization, where all proposals and ideas are debated
in public and are visible to the entire community. There is always a
public debate on ideas and proposals.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="student-proposals"><a class="anchor" href="#student-proposals"></a>GSoC Contributor Proposals</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We expect proposals from contributors to contain all the sections discussed in the
<a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/">Google Summer of Code Guide</a>,
specifically the <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal#elements-of-a-quality-proposal">Elements of a Quality Proposal</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors need to use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIlPLXfLbFsvcaHFuwmH9_lSCVm9m6-SgNYTNAnSZpY/">project proposal template</a>
to write their proposals. Contributor proposals should not be confused with <a href="../proposing-project-ideas">project ideas</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We strongly encourage contributors to engage with the mentors as early as
possible. If you wait until the last few days to submit a proposal,
mentors will not have time to discuss with you, and your chances of
being accepted are greatly diminished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can have additional sections or paragraphs if they are applicable:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A contribution history section: if you participated in any open-source projects or proposed any patches in Jenkins, you can definitely list them in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appendix section of detailed design, architecture or implementation. This section could contain code samples, pseudo-code, diagrams, mock UIs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A section related to testing your project: unit tests, integration tests, test automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A section or paragraph on deliverables: demos, presentations, releases (alpha, official).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A section or paragraph on improvements, bug fixes, benefits to the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other section that the contributor deems is applicable and helps the proposal</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the proposal, we also expect contributors to disclose all known commitments
that overlap with any of the program phases (community bonding, coding
periods, evaluation periods, etc.):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Disclose your vacations periods, part-time or full-time job, school, classes, tests, exams, periods of non-availability, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure to disclose known commitments may lead to immediate failure,
especially in the case of another jobs or internship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unexpected events: we understand there can be unexpected events in life, and those cannot be planned. Please inform us as soon as possible if you need time away from the program. You can use private messaging for sensitive information.</p>

Only proposals submitted before the deadline to the Google Summer of Code website are considered.</p>

<td class="content">
The secret to making excellent presentations is to be ready ahead of time, and practice, practice, practice.
Write a script, and practice out loud, exaggerate enunciation when you practice, and put on a little smile to lift your voice just enough.
If you create a slide or two per week on the work you have done that week, you will be ready.
Repeating a presentation numerous times will help you breeze through it with fluidity.

<h2 id="codestyle"><a class="anchor" href="#codestyle"></a>Code Style Best Practices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GSoC contributors should adopt best practices as soon as possible in their coding career.
Learn to configure your IDE to have proper spacing and proper indentation is a must.
By default, the IDE you use may not have the correct settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Best practices include topics such as space and indentation, naming conventions for
variables, class members, methods, classes. These are all important when writing code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best practices can be learned:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Code+Style+Guidelines">Code Style Guidelines</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By reading existing code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By asking mentors or submit a pull-request and ask for review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By reading code style guidelines of other organizations found on the internet. Here are some popular ones:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md">Twitter Style Guide</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://petroware.no/javastyle.html">Petroware Java Programming Style Guidelines</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documenting code with Javadoc can be learned by imitation, but it is better to read the reference:
it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to testing, Jenkins projects must come with:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Unit+Test">Unit</a> tests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and for plugins, <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness">Acceptance Test Harness</a> tests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project is a plugin and you are ready to release it,
you also need to learn the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins">plugin release process</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="discourse-channel-mailing-list"><a class="anchor" href="#discourse-channel-mailing-list"></a>Discourse Channel &amp; Mailing List</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the Jenkins community is distributed across all time zones,
and since the gitter chat rooms are more difficult to search,
we recommend using the Discourse channel for most of the communications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors should join the following Jenkins mailing lists:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://community.jenkins.io" class="bare">https://community.jenkins.io</a></em> - sync-ups on GSoC organizational topics (meeting scheduling, process Q&amp;A).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com</em> - for all technical discussions and the project application (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev">archives</a>).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Join this list after talking to the org admins and/or the project mentors, and once the project is ready to be discussed with the developers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other mailing lists:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/projects/gsoc/#orgadmin">Org admins mailing list</a>- for <strong>private</strong> communications with org admins (escalations, issues with mentors)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use this mailing list for applications and intro emails</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="chat"><a class="anchor" href="#chat"></a>Chat</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the <a href="https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig">Jenkins GSoC Gitter Chat</a>
for office hours and real-time discussions.
Note that mentors and org-admins may be unavailable in the chat outside the Office Hours slots (see below).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the projects are announced, mentors and students may switch to another communication channel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="officehours"><a class="anchor" href="#officehours"></a>Office hours</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to chat, Discourse and mailing lists, we have regular office hours for sync-ups
between students, org admins and mentors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the <a href="/projects/gsoc/#office-hours">main GSoC page</a> for the schedule.</p>

<h2 id="post-gsoc"><a class="anchor" href="#post-gsoc"></a>Post-GSoC</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, you have made it to the end!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once GSoC is over, final results are announced by Google. But this is not the end of the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Continue to develop your project within the Jenkins community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present your work at a local <a href="/projects/jam">Jenkins Area Meetup</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in other Jenkins projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate again next year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a mentor in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> for next year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a mentor in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code In</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the project results, and available budget, we may offer a sponsored trip
to <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/">DevOps World</a> or another Jenkins-related event to contributors
who successfully finish their projects.
This sponsorship is not guaranteed though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If contributors agree to go to such event, we expect contributors to present their project and to write a blog-post about the trip.
In 2018, one of our students, Pham Vu Tuan, attended DevOps World - Jenkins World,
and wrote <a href="https://pvtuan10.github.io/essays/20181019-DWJW18.html">this blog post</a> about it.</p>
