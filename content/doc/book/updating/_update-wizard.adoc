== Post-update setup wizard

There are a few post upgrade steps to perform.

Verify the version update ::

The Jenkins server is up and running.
Let's now verify the version from the Jenkins dashboard:

The upgraded Jenkins version can be seen in the bottom right corner of the Jenkins UI.

Upgrading Jenkins Java Version From 8 to 11 ::
Jenkins updates its minimum Java requirement every two years.
The link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/[Java support policy] provides more details.
Java 17 is also supported as of the 2.361.1 Long Term Support release.
Therefore, a best practice is to verify your Java version if you are upgrading from an older version.
To upgrade Jenkins from Java 8 to Java 11, refer to the link:/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-guidelines/[Upgrade Java Guideline]
and link:/doc/administration/requirements/java/[Java requirements].

Compatibility with the new version ::

Plugins are one of the most crucial parts of the Jenkins pipeline.
In fact, each job uses a plugin for its execution.
Check the available updates for installed plugins:

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
. Select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane on the left side of the Jenkins dashboard.
. Select *Manage Plugins*.

The above image shows that there is no need to update any plugins.

Sometimes a Jenkins plugin changes the data that it is storing.
In other cases, a plugin that has been uninstalled may have left data in the system that Jenkins no longer needs.
The link:/doc/book/managing/plugins/#removing-old-data["Manage old data"] page allows administrators to remove those unused items.

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard
. Select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane, on the left side of the Jenkins dashboard.

The above image shows that our new version isn't compatible with the old version.
However, we can fix the problem by selecting the *Manage* option.
