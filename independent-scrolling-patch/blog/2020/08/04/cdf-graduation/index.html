<p>We are happy to announce that the Jenkins project has achieved the <strong>graduated status</strong> in
the <a href="https://cd.foundation/">Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)</a>.
This status is officially effective Aug 03, 2020.
Jenkins is the first project to graduate in the CD Foundation.
Thanks to all contributors who made our graduation possible!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article, we will discuss what the CD Foundation membership and graduation mean to the Jenkins community.

<h2 id="how-does-cdf-membership-help-us"><a class="anchor" href="#how-does-cdf-membership-help-us"></a>How does CDF membership help us?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About 18 months ago, Jenkins <a href="/blog/2019/03/12/cdf-launch/">became one of the CDF founding projects</a>, along with Jenkins X, Spinnaker and Tekton.
A new foundation was formed to provide a vendor-neutral home for open source projects used for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.
Special interest groups were started to foster collaboration between projects and end user companies,
most notably:
<a href="https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability">Interoperability</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-mlops">MLOps</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-security">Security</a> SIGs.
Also, a <a href="https://cd.foundation/ambassador-program-overview-application/">Community Ambassador</a> role was created to organize local meetups and to provide public-facing community representatives.
Many former Jenkins Ambassadors and other contributors are now CDF Ambassadors, and they promote Jenkins and other projects there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thanks to this membership we addressed key <a href="/projects/infrastructure/">project infrastructure</a> needs.
Starting from Jan 2020, CDF covers a significant part of the infrastructure costs
including our services and CI/CD instances running on Microsoft Azure.
The CD Foundation provided us with legal assistance required to get code signing keys for the Jenkins project.
Thanks to that, we were able to switch to a new <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release">Jenkins Release Infrastructure</a>.
The foundation sponsors the Zoom account we use for <a href="/events/online-meetup/">Jenkins Online Meetups</a> and community meetings.
In the future we will continue to review ways of reducing maintenance overhead by switching some of our self-hosted services to equivalents provided by the Linux Foundation to CDF members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important CDF membership benefit is community outreach and marketing.
It helped us to establish connections with other CI/CD projects and end user companies.
Through the foundation we have access to the <a href="https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/">DevStats service</a>
that provides community contribution statistics and helps us track trends and discover areas for improvement.
On the marketing side, the foundation organizes webinars, podcasts and newsletters.
Jenkins is regularly represented there.
The CD Foundation also runs the meetup.com professional account which is used by local Jenkins communities for
<a href="/projects/jam/">CI/CD and Jenkins Area Meetups</a>.
Last but not least, the Jenkins community is also represented at virtual conferences where CDF has a booth.
All of that helps to grow Jenkins visibility and to highlight new features and initiatives in the project.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project has a long history of open governance which is a key part of today&#8217;s project success.
Starting from <strong>2011</strong>, the project has introduced <a href="/project/governance-meeting/">the governance meeting</a> which are open to anyone.
Most of the discussions and decision making happen publicly in the <a href="/mailing-lists/">mailing lists</a>.
<strong>In 2015</strong> we introduced teams, sub-projects and officer roles.
<strong>In 2017</strong> we introduced the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal</a> process which helped us to make the key architecture and governance decisions more open and transparent to the community and the Jenkins users.
<strong>In 2018</strong> we introduced <a href="/sigs">special interest groups</a> that focus on community needs.
<strong>In 2019</strong> we have <a href="/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/">expanded the Jenkins governance board</a>
so that it got more bandwidth to facilitate initiatives in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the Jenkins project inception 15 years ago, it has been steadily growing.
Now it has millions of users and thousands of contributors.
In 2019 it has seen <strong>5,433 contributors</strong> from 111 countries and 272 companies,
67 core and 2,654 plugin releases,
45,484 commits, 7,000+ pull requests.
In 2020 Q2 the project has seen <strong>21% growth</strong> in pull requests numbers compared to 2019 Q2, bots excluded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One may say that the Jenkins project already has everything needed to succeed.
It is a result of continuous work by many community members,
and this work will never end as long as the project remains active.
Like in any other industry, the CI/CD ecosystem changes every day and sets new expectations from the automation tools in this domain.
Just as the tools evolve, open source communities need to evolve so that they can address expectations, and onboard more users and contributors.
The CDF graduation process helped us to discover opportunities for improvement,
and address them.
We reviewed the project processes and compared them with the Graduated Project criteria defined in the <a href="https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md">CDF project lifecycle</a>.
Based on this review, we made changes in our processes and documentation.
It should improve the experience of Jenkins users,
and help to make the Jenkins community more welcoming to existing and newcomer contributors.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below you can find a few key changes we have applied during the graduation process:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Public roadmap</dt>
<dd>
<p>We introduced a new <a href="/project/roadmap/">public roadmap</a> for the Jenkins project.
This roadmap aggregates key initiatives in all community areas: features, infrastructure, documentation, community, etc.
It makes the project more transparent to all Jenkins users and adopters,
and at the same time helps potential contributors find the hot areas and opportunities for contribution.
The roadmap is driven by the Jenkins community and it has a fully public process documented in <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/14/README.adoc">JEP-14</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More details about the public roadmap are coming next week, stay tuned for a separate blogpost.
On July 10th we had an online contributor meetup about the roadmap
and you can find more information in its materials
(<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_T2nZhP1WS2Fw0OLVAJV14Ke6nEsqBjLcdAHiygCmNs/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldWBY5BdQ5I">video recording</a>).</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jenkins Weekly Release line is now documented on our website (<a href="/download/weekly/">here</a>).
We have also reworked the downloads page and added guidelines explaining how to verify downloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <a href="/project/adopters">list of Jenkins adopters</a> was introduced on jenkins.io.
This list highlights Jenkins users and references their case studies and success stories,
including ones submitted through the <a href="/blog/2020/04/30/jenkins-is-the-way/">Jenkins Is The Way</a> portal.
Please do not hesitate to add your company there!</p>

<dd>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We passed the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)</a> certification.
This certification helps us to verify compliance with open source best practices
and to make adjustments in the project (see the bullets below).
It also provides Jenkins users and adopters with a public summary about compliance with each best practice.
Details are on the <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3538">Jenkins core page</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/project/conduct/">Jenkins Code of Conduct was updated</a>
to the new version of Contributor Covenant.
In particular, it sets best practices of behavior in the community, and expands definitions of unacceptable behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The default <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Jenkins contributing template</a> was updated to cover more common cases for plugin contributors.
This page provides links to the <a href="/participate">Participate and Contribute</a> guidelines hosted on our website,
and helps potential contributors to easily access the documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jenkins Core <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc">maintainer guide</a> was updated to include maintenance and issues triage guidelines.
It should help us to deliver quality releases and to timely triage and address issues reported by Jenkins users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It an honor to be the first project to reach the graduated stage in the Continuous Delivery Foundation,
but it is also a great responsibility for the project.
As a project, we plan to continue participating in the CDF activities and to work with other projects and end users to maintain the Jenkins' leader role in the CI/CD space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We encourage everyone to join the project and <a href="/participate/">participate</a> in evolving the Jenkins project and driving its roadmap.
It does not necessarily mean committing code or documentation patches;
user feedback is also very important to the project.
If you are interested to contribute or to share your feedback,
please contact us in the Jenkins community channels (<a href="/mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>, <a href="/chat">chats</a>)!</p>
