Upgrading Jenkins Java Version From 8 to 11 ::
Jenkins has transitioned from Java 8 to Java 11 as a baseline requirement.
Java 17 is also supported, therefore a best practice is to verify your Java version if you are upgrading from an older version.
To upgrade Jenkins from Java 8 to Java 11,
Visit the
link:/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-guidelines/[Upgrade Java Guideline]
and the
link:/doc/administration/requirements/java/[Java requirements].

Compatibility with the new version ::

Plugins are one of the most crucial parts of the Jenkins pipeline.
In fact, each job uses a plugin for its execution.
Check the available updates for installed plugins:

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
. Select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane on the left side of the Jenkins dashboard.
. Select  *Manage Plugins*.

The above image shows that there is no need to update any plugins.

After upgrading Jenkins, you may encounter data compatibility issues with the new version.
To ensure that our data is in the correct format, we should update it to the correct format.
To check the data version update, follow these steps:

. Go to the Jenkins dashboard
. Select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane, on the left side of the Jenkins dsahboard.

The above image shows that our new version isn't compatible with the old version.
However, we can fix the problem by selecting the *Manage* option.
