<h2 id="core-features"><a class="anchor" href="#core-features"></a>Core features</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins core delivered 53 weekly releases and 14 long term support releases in 2021.
Hundreds of plugin releases were delivered in 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The releases included user interface improvements, security improvements, security fixes, dependency replacements, dependency updates, and more.
Contributors from around the world provided the changes included in those releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="configuration-form-modernization"><a class="anchor" href="#configuration-form-modernization"></a>Configuration form modernization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the culmination of 12 months of work by many different people, Jenkins modernized its configuration forms in Jenkins 2.277.1.
The Jenkins user interface is now much better adapted to narrow screens and modern web layout techniques.
It works well on all modern web browsers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration form modernization introduction included a <a href="/changelog-stable/#v2.277.1">changelog</a>, an <a href="/doc/upgrade-guide/2.277/#configuration-form-modernization">upgrade guide</a>, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvgtRXGcyOM">introductory webinar</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="dependency-updates"><a class="anchor" href="#dependency-updates"></a>Dependency updates</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many outdated Jenkins dependencies were updated or replaced by 2021 development work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins core security library was converted from a forked copy of Acegi Security to the most recent release of the standard Spring Security library.
The Jenkins core XML serialization library was converted from a forked copy of the XStream library to the most recent release of the standard XStream library.
The Jenkins internal class management libraries were converted from a forked copy of Apache Ant libraries to the most recent release of the standard Apache Ant libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Outdated libraries were removed from Jenkins core including ASM 5, ASM 6, Apache Commons Digester, Bytecode Compatibility Transformer, Akuma, Woodstox, JNA Posix, JTidy, and libpam4j.
Removals were accompanied by plugin updates as needed to retain compatibility and functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key libraries were updated to use more recent releases of the libraries.
Guava was upgraded from 11.0.1 to 31.0.1.
Guice was upgraded from 4.0 to 5.0.1.
Groovy was upgraded from 2.4.12 to 2.4.21.
Many Apache Commons libraries were upgraded to their most recent releases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="continuous-delivery-for-plugins"><a class="anchor" href="#continuous-delivery-for-plugins"></a>Continuous delivery for plugins</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuous delivery of Jenkins components was proposed in 2020 by Jesse Glick as <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/229/README.adoc">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 229</a>.
By the end of 2021, 119 plugins had adopted continuous delivery, providing new plugin releases each time a relevant commit was merged to the plugin repository.
Additional components have adopted continuous delivery as well, including the plugin bill of materials and the Jenkins test harness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We look forward to even greater adoption of continuous delivery for plugins in 2022.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="prefer-java-11-instead-of-java-8"><a class="anchor" href="#prefer-java-11-instead-of-java-8"></a>Prefer Java 11 instead of Java 8</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java 11 was adopted as the recommended JDK during 2021.
Docker images now use JDK 11 by default.
See the <a href="/blog/2021/08/17/docker-images-use-jdk-11-by-default/">blogpost</a> for more information about the Docker image transition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Docker images with Java 11 are also available for multiple platforms, including 64 bit ARM and IBM s390x.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="more-inclusive-naming"><a class="anchor" href="#more-inclusive-naming"></a>More inclusive naming</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins project decided in 2016 to replace the term "slave" with the more inclusive term "agent".
In July 2020 the project adopted the "controller" term to replace the older term "master".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins core 2.319.1 was released in December 2021 replaced the term "master" with more accurate terminology.
The release also includes an integrated migration tool to allow existing installations to decide when they would adopt the new terminology.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="security-improvements"><a class="anchor" href="#security-improvements"></a>Security improvements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins security improvements have continued throughout 2021.
The Jenkins security team provided timely responses to security issues in Jenkins core and in Jenkins plugins.
The project is sincerely grateful to <a href="/blog/authors/daniel-beck/">Daniel Beck</a> for his years of service as Jenkins Security Officer.
<a href="/blog/authors/wadeck/">Wadeck Follonier</a> began his service as Jenkins Security Officer in December, 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jenkins infrastructure team resolved infrastructure issues and safeguarded Jenkins infrastructure.
The project is deeply grateful to <a href="/blog/authors/olblak/">Olivier Vernin</a> for his years of service as Jenkins Infrastructure Officer.
<a href="/blog/authors/dduportal/">Damien Duportal</a> began his service as Jenkins Infrastructure Officer in December, 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="agent-to-controller-security"><a class="anchor" href="#agent-to-controller-security"></a>Agent to controller security</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Daniel Beck proposed <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/235">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 235</a> in November, 2021 to remove the ability to disable or customize the agent-to-controller security system.
Telemetry has been added to Jenkins releases beginning with 2.319.1 and Jenkins 2.326.
The telemetry reports agent use of methods to access files on the controller.
As controller file access from agents is detected by the telemetry, issues are raised to remove that access from the offending plugin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="log4j-2-zero-day-vulnerability"><a class="anchor" href="#log4j-2-zero-day-vulnerability"></a>Log4j 2 zero day vulnerability</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>December 2021 included the announcement of multiple zero day vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j 2 library.
The Jenkins security team assessed the impact of the vulnerabilities and confirmed that Jenkins core was not affected by the vulnerabilities.
Further research showed that Jenkins plugins might be affected by the vulnerabilities.
Instructions were <a href="/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/">shared in a blogpost</a> so that Jenkins administrators could check their system for issues.
A <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67353">Jira epic</a> tracks the progress of corrections in the plugins that were including the affected Apache Log4j 2 library versions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="jenkins-confluence-instance-shutdown"><a class="anchor" href="#jenkins-confluence-instance-shutdown"></a>Jenkins Confluence instance shutdown</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In September, 2021, a zero day vulnerability was disclosed in the Confluence version used in the Jenkins project.
The infrastructure team permanently disabled the service, rotated privileged credentials, and actively reduced the scope of access across the Jenkins infrastructure.
Passwords for all user accounts on jenkins.io were reset.
Users were required to perform a password recovery in order to regain access to their jenkins.io accounts.
 See the <a href="/blog/2021/09/04/wiki-attacked/">blogpost</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The page content from the Jenkins Confluence instance has been returned to service as static HTML pages.
The plugin documentation from the Jenkins Confluence instance is now integrated into the plugin site build process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="master-project-in-jenkins-security"><a class="anchor" href="#master-project-in-jenkins-security"></a>Master project in Jenkins security</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wadeck Follonier coordinated and mentored an end-of-study security research project for four students during the last year of their Master&#8217;s Degree - Reliability and IT Security at the University of Aix-Marseille.
The students applied their university training to audit Jenkins core and many Jenkins plugins for specific types of security issues.
Their project resulted in 14 vulnerabilities reported in Jenkins security advisories.
More details of their results and their processes are available in the <a href="/blog/2021/06/21/student-luminy-project-security/">blogpost</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io">Jenkins plugins site</a> has become the definitive location for information about Jenkins plugins.
It successfully presents plugin documentation, changelogs, and dependencies for over 1100 plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Site search is provided by an Algolia open source sponsorship for easy and accurate search of Jenkins plugins.
Search performance reports are used to refine and improve the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jenkins plugin maintainers migrated plugin documentation for over 200 plugins into plugin repositories.
Documentation in GitHub repositories is easier to update, easier to manage, and more likely to be correct.</p>

Discourse sponsors the internet forum management software that runs the community site.
The site hosts question and answer forums, highlights novel and interesting use of Jenkins, and encourages users to help one another.
See the <a href="https://community.jenkins.io/t/2021-the-year-in-review/1149">"2021: Year in Review"</a> page for more details on the use and evolution of the community site.</p>

<p>This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.
We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.
Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.
THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!</p>
