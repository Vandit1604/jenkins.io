The procedures in this chapter are for upgrading Jenkins.

Jenkins can be installed with operating system specific installers like link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/#windows-msi-installers[MSI], link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#red-hat-centos[RPM], and link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu[DEB] installers.
When upgrading Jenkins, the process used must match the original installation method:
* If Jenkins was installed with an operating system specific installer, it should be upgraded with an operating system specific installer.
* If Jenkins was installed as a standalone application, it should be upgraded as a standalone application.
