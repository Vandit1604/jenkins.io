</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Community</strong>.
Over the past year we had <strong>5433</strong> contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).
We had <strong>1892</strong> unique committers who created <strong>7122</strong> pull requests and <strong>45484</strong> commits, bots excluded.
Contributors represent <strong>273</strong> companies and <strong>111</strong> countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.
The most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.
The most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: <strong>915</strong> unique contributors, <strong>124</strong> of them were first-timers, thanks to <a href="/events/hacktoberfest/">Hacktoberfest</a>!.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Jenkins core</strong>.
In 2019 Jenkins core had <strong>54</strong> weekly and <strong>13</strong> LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.
There was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.
We also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support ðŸ¥³.
There was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.
The core&#8217;s components also got major updates.
Only <a href="/projects/remoting/">Jenkins Remoting</a> got <strong>11</strong> releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.
There are also major incoming features like <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/222/README.adoc">JEP-222: WebSocket Services support</a>, UI look&amp;feel updates, <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-12548">JENKINS-12548: Readonly system configuration support</a>, Docker images for new platforms like Arm.
To facilitate further changes we created a new <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/0sdrcSOQW64/tD-IKDTsBQAJ">Core pull request reviewers team</a> and added <strong>9</strong> contributors there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Plugins</strong>.
There were <strong>2654</strong> plugin releases, and <strong>157</strong> NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.
Jenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.
Also, warm welcome back to the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/scriptler">Scriptler Plugin</a> which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.
If you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool">Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool</a> which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Security</strong>.
It was a hot year for the <a href="/security/">Jenkins Security Team</a>.
There were <strong>5</strong> <a href="/security/advisories/">security advisories</a> for the core and <strong>20</strong> - for plugins.
In total we disclosed <strong>288</strong> vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.
<a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security">Script Security Plugin</a> was the hottest plugin with <strong>10</strong> critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.
Plain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type <strong>120</strong> disclosures in 2019.
It was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,
special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/woodspeed">Viktor Gazdag</a> who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story <a href="/blog/2019/11/29/do-plugins-store-credentials-in-a-secure-way/">here</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>.
Got Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.
All these and many other services are maintained by the <a href="/projects/infrastructure/">Jenkins Infrastructure Team</a>.
This year the team handled <strong>more than 400</strong> requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.
In total, more than <strong>30</strong> people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).
We also deployed <strong>4</strong> new services, migrated <strong>7</strong> services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.
More changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for <a href="/projects/infrastructure/#team">new INFRA team members</a>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>.
Only last quarter we had <strong>178</strong> contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.
There is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub (<a href="link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/">announcement</a>).
Since the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than <strong>150</strong> plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.
You can see the current status <a href="https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress">here</a>.
We also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.
<strong>123</strong> plugins have already adopted the new <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc">changelog tools</a>, powered by Release Drafter.
Also, we had more than <strong>60</strong> technical <a href="/blog">blog posts</a> published on jenkins.io.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Configuration as Code</strong> was one of the most popular areas this year.
<a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code">Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin</a> had more than <strong>30</strong> releases with new features and bug fixes.
More than <strong>50</strong> plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.
As a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from <strong>2000</strong> to almost <strong>8000</strong> installations),
and now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.
This year we also ran our very first <a href="https://communitybridge.org/">CommunityBridge</a> project devoted to <a href="/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/">JCasC Schema validation and developer tools</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Events and outreach programs</strong>.
In 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.
More than <strong>40</strong> Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.
We also kept expanding our <a href="/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/">outreach programs</a>.
In total we had <strong>12</strong> students who participated in <a href="/projects/gsoc/2019/">Google Summer of Code</a>, <a href="/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/">Outreachy</a> and newly introduced <a href="/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/#community-bridge">Community Bridge</a>.
We also had the biggest ever <a href="/events/hacktoberfest/">Hacktoberfest</a> with <strong>664</strong> pull requests and <strong>102</strong> participants.
These outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.
For example, this year we added <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-sourcep">Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab</a> and a new <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool">Plugin Installation Manager Tool</a> during GSoC,
and Outreachy resulted in a new <a href="/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/">Audit Log Plugin</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where did we get those stats?
GitHub stats came from the <a href="https://devstats.cd.foundation/">CDF DevStats</a> service.
These stats include all repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">jenkinsci organization</a> and most popular repositories in <a href="https://github.com/jenkins-infra">jenkins-infra</a>, Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.
Other stats came from <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTeUXM75UR8m_v5FbldYYNXeVW0CtXkpRydMRvQjBuew2vRyC4cjgLMSUEVNoonfYbKDSbOvasHPpxg">project reports</a>, component changelogs, <a href="https://stats.jenkins.io/">Jenkins usage statistics service</a>, <a href="https://updates.jenkins.io/current/release-history.json">plugin releases history</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next"><a class="anchor" href="#whats-next"></a>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Year 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.
As it was written <a href="/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/#whats-next-for-the-board">Board elections blogpost</a>,
there are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
In the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in <a href="/mailing-lists/">mailing lists</a> and <a href="/sigs/">special interest groups</a>,
and we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next month we will participate in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/">FOSDEM</a>, and there will be a Jenkins stand there.
On January 31st we will also host a traditional <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/267684785/">contributor summit in Brussels</a>,
where we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.
If you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!
See <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/PUgV5xxHMwgp">this thread</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also plan to continue all outreach programs.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas (<a href="/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/">announcement</a>),
and we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.
We also work on improving <a href="/participate/">contribution guidelines</a> for newcomers and expert contributors.
If you are interested, please contact the <a href="/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/">Advocacy and Outreach SIG</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="and-even-more"><a class="anchor" href="#and-even-more"></a>And even more</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.
We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.
Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.
THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.
And stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!</p>
