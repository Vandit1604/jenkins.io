The procedures in this chapter are for Upgrading Jenkins.

Jenkins can be installed with operating system specific installers like MSI, RPM, and DEB installers.
Jenkins can also be installed and run as a standalone application in its own process.
Upgrades should match the original installation.
If Jenkins was installed with an operating system specific installer, then it should be upgraded with an operating system specific installer.
If Jenkins was installed as a standalone application, it should be upgraded as a standalone application.
