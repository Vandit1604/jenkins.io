   This credential is only available to the object on which the credential is associated. Typically you would use system-scoped credentials for things like email auth, agent connection, etc, i.e. where the Jenkins instance itself is using the credential.

 <p>In general, a credential is defined in one place (e.g., the credentials configuration page under "Manage Jenkins") and then used in another place (e.g., when connecting to a new SSH build agent).

<li><code>servicePrincipalId : String</code>
<div><div>
 The Azure Service Principal credentials used to communicate with the Azure services. Check the following documentation for more information about the service principal:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal" rel="nofollow"> Use portal to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources </a></li>
 </ul>
</div></div>

</li>
<li><code>secretIdentifier : String</code>
<div><div>
 <p>Secret identifier can be found on Azure Portal.</p>
 <p>Secret value will be interpreted as yaml. The following is an example</p>
 <pre>        username: jenkins
        passphrase:
        privateKey: |
          -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
          MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAnWLC5QGdQNii4oDosvY5hXEGOGQXFsw1YFMkyG+xY5kUIxc3
          :

          -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    </pre>
 <p>The following example uses the az-cli to load a yaml file as a secret into an Azure Keyvault</p>
 <pre>    az keyvault secret --vault-name jenkins --name ssh-cred --file ssh-cred.yaml
    </pre>

 Determines where this credential can be used.

   System
  </dt>
  <dd>
   This credential is only available to the object on which the credential is associated. Typically you would use system-scoped credentials for things like email auth, agent connection, etc, i.e. where the Jenkins instance itself is using the credential. Unlike the global scope, this significantly restricts where the credential can be used, thereby providing a higher degree of confidentiality to the credential.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   Global
  </dt>
  <dd>
   This credential is available to the object on which the credential is associated and all objects that are children of that object. Typically you would use global-scoped credentials for things that are needed by jobs.
  </dd>

 <p>In general, a credential is defined in one place (e.g., the credentials configuration page under "Manage Jenkins") and then used in another place (e.g., when connecting to a new SSH build agent). The scope allows you to say "this credential is only used by these places" by looking at the relationship between the two locations.</p>
